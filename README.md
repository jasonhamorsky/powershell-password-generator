# PowerShell Password Generator

A simple PowerShell script that generates random passwords. I built this to practice loops, randomness, and string manipulation in PowerShell.

## How it works
- You choose a password length (default is 12)
- The script picks random characters from a defined set
- It outputs a strong, random password

## Run it
.\Generate-Password.ps1
.\Generate-Password.ps1 -Length 20
